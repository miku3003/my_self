<h2>MRIDUL DASHORA</h2>
			<p>My name is MRIDUL DASHORA. I have lived in RAWATBHATA in RAJASTHAN.
                Some of my favorite things to do are read, 
                listen to music, and ride public transportation (buses and trains).
                These are activities that I enjoy immensely and indulge in daily.
                My career aspirations are to become either an IT Developer. I have been told that I am a charming, kind, attitude-prone 
                a person with "oddities". I look up mostly to my family members.</p>
            <p>I'm ready to deal with various undertakings consistently. I utilize an innovative way to deal with issue-solving. 
                I am a reliable individual who is perfect at using time effectively.</p>
